## How to use
Download one the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-natural-advanced/fkjippcbpjcnjfoohfhaghfelfanamee) or clone the repo and use this as a development extension.

If you type in a search field and get a matching advanced search suggestion you press shift + enter, to apply it. It wont apply automatically when pressing enter.

You can toggle suggestions and keywords with ctrl + space.


## How it works
It uses [query.quantleaf.com](https://query.quantleaf.com) under the hood to convert natural languages to the advanced search format. See the file *inject.js* to learn about how it was implemented for this tool.
