# Twitter Natural Advanced Search
This is a small chrome extension which lets you twitter search fields auto detect search that resembles "advanced search", that is currently today accesible through the advanced search UI or through their own syntax that might not be the easiest.

## How to use
Currently not available on the Chrome store. Please clone repo and use this as a development extension to test it.

If you type in a search field and get a matching advanced search suggestion you press shift + enter, to apply it. It wont apply automatically when pressing enter.

You can toggle suggestions and keywords with ctrl + space.


## How it works
It uses Quantleaf Query under the hood to map natural languages to the advanced search format. See *index.js* for reference.
